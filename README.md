# Nepal-Map
An attempt to visualize the country's map using TopoJSON inputs for geographical data.

Hello Everyone!

This small project aims to plot a base map of Nepal using D3 and TopoJSON for viewing in modern web browsers. 
Currently the map color codes regions based population growth rates of different districts; the intensity of the color reflects the intensity of the growth rate. The idea is for the user to be able to choose key metrics--such as growth rate, literacy rate--from a select option which would then color code the map based on the value of the selected metric
As of now, I haven't added a legend to the graph. Users can view the population of the required district by simply hovering on the map. 

Regards,
Arogya Koirala
